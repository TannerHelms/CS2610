<h3>Phase 0: Requirements Specification</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px">
    <p>
        The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to use apis and javascript in order
        to update the dom without having to refresh the page. We also learned how to create our
        own REST API in Django.
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Phase 1: Design</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px">
    <p>
        We need to create our models first so that we can set up the database correctly. Once the models were
        created, we then needed to create our migrations so that the models can be setup as tables in the db.
        Then we needed to add populate migration file to the migrations so that we can have some different factors
        that we can convert to. Then we need to update our urls file so that we can have end points to the calculator
        and this plan. Next, we need to create our template directory that contains all of our html pages that
        will load our dynamic content. Lastly, we need to create our static files, which is a directory that contains all
        of our images and css. Then we need to setup the API between our javascript and the nasdaq database so that
        we can get the current price of gold per troy ounce. Then we need to create an API in django that will be able
        to do unit conversions of the different types of factors that we want. Once that is done, we need to write some
        javascript that will be able to interact with the API. For the factors for converting, I got them off google.com
    </p>

<h3>Phase 2: Implementation</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px">
    <p>
        While implementing the things from the previous step, I learned a lot. The first thing that I really
        learned was how to use the Fetch statement in javascript in order to do HTTP Requests. Then I also learned
        how to setup a rest API in Django in order to send this data to, so that we can make different conversions.
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Phase 3: Testing & Debugging</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px">
    <p>
        For testing & Debugging, I just entered a bunch of different values into a calculator to make sure that I didnt
        break it. I also send a lot of HTTP Requests to the REST API in Django in order to test if that was possible to
        break it. I also tested if the connection failed to the API and made sure that it could handle that.
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Phase 4: Deployment</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px;">
    <p>
       I made sure that my code was pushed to the repository correctly and that I could clone the repo onto
        another computer and use it. Everything went well. A couple of times I added some new code and had some mistakes
        so i used the git compare to see what I did wrong. This was very useful
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Phase 5: Maintenance</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px;">
    <p>
        In the future, I dont think there will be too much maintenance to be done. I wrote templates that can be easily
        modified so that it doesnt take much time to make changes on the page. The page also has good css so it looks
        good and I dont think it will need to be changed much in the future. The only thing that I would really need
        to pay attention to is the nasdeq api to see if there are any changes to that. If there are changes, then I need
        to re-write some javascript in order to fix that connection.
    </p>

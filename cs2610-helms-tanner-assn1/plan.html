<h3>Phase 0: Requirements Specification</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px">
    <p>
        The purpose of this assignment was to take our webpages that we built before and
        put them on a server using python. Then we can use GET requests to get the pages
        and display the correlation codes that go with the pages
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Phase 1: Design</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px">
    <p>
        For the design portion of this project, we are going to need a couple functions. One of the function
        will be the GET method where we handle various different files paths. We will also need a function to
        write headers for us based on the given codes. This is because every page needs headers so we dont
        want to write this code a bunch of times. Finally, we need a function that will serve an actual file.
        We will read the file, then write it to the self.wfile.write
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Phase 2: Implementation</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px">
    <p>
        A couple things I learned was that I needed to use netcat a lot to figure out what my errors were.
        It can be hard to tell where you make mistakes when only using the browser
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Phase 3: Testing & Debugging</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px">
    <p>
        For testing and debugging, I had to go through every page and make nothing would break my code. Then
        I had to go to various incorrect urls and made sure that I handled all of these with the correct error
        codes
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Phase 4: Deployment</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px;">
    <p>
       I made sure that my code was pushed to the repository correctly and that I could clone the repo onto
        another computer and use it. Everything went well. A couple times I added some new code and had some mistakes
        so i used the git compare to see what I did wrong. This was very useful

    </p>

</div>
<h3>Phase 5: Maintenance</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px;">
    <p>
        In the future, I dont think there will be too much maintenance to be done. I wrote the code in a robust
        way that I will be able to easily handle new files and types of files. I only handled 5 different types of files
        in this case. But maybe in the future I could support more different file types
    </p>

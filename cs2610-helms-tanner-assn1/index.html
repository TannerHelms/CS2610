            With the world what it is these days, you can see why people
            might be itching for an alternate reality a way to reboot the
            system and start fresh. Thats the appeal of virtual realms:
            Theyre places where power can be inverted, disappointments escaped,
            and capitalist inequities left behind for something more exciting, malleable, and meaningful.

                It's been nearly six months since Facebook announced it was rebranding to Meta and
                would focus its future on the upcoming metaverse. In the time since, what that term
                means hasn't gotten any clearer. Meta is building a VR social platform, Roblox is
                facilitating user-generated video games, and some companies are offering up little
                more than broken game worlds that happen to have NFTs attached.

                Technology is neutral. It can bring prosperity to humanity or bring pain and destruction to society. The
                metaverse will not be any different. We can expect any of the crimes committed in the real world to take
                place, and potentially explode, on the immersive internet. After all, criminals will be active anywhere
                there is money to be made, and the metaverse will be an infinite blue ocean full of countless
                opportunities for consumers, creators, and organizations to make money.

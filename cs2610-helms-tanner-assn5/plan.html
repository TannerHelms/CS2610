<h3>Phase 0: Requirements Specification</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px">
    <p>
        The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to use vue.js to fetch data from an api and put it on the dom
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Phase 1: Design</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px">
    <p>
        For the design portion of this app, I started out with create an api key for the website. Once I had the api key,
        I looked at the documentation to figure out how to use it. I did some requests to the api in the browser to make sure
        I was getting the information that I needed. Then I started on the index page and created some boilerplate and begun
        working on the vue.js file. I got the fetch calls working to the weather api and then begun parsing the data to show on 
        page. once that I was done, did some error checking and handled the edge cases
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Phase 2: Implementation</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px">
    <p>
        I really enjoyed this project a lot and learned a lot while doing it. I liked how vue automatically knows what to update on the dom
        as the vars change. I also like implementing the API and having a loading circle while its doing the fetch call
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Phase 3: Testing & Debugging</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px">
    <p>
        For testing and debugging, I spent a lot of time at the beginning making sure that I understood the API and how it works. 
        I also used a lot of logs in the console.
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Phase 4: Deployment</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px;">
    <p>
       I made sure that my code was pushed to the repository correctly and that I could clone the repo onto
        another computer and use it. Everything went well. A couple of times I added some new code and had some mistakes
        so i used the git compare to see what I did wrong. This was very useful
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Phase 5: Maintenance</h3>
<div style="margin-left:60px;">
    <p>
        In the future, I dont think there will be too much maintenance to be done. The only thing that would really change is the weather API
        if they decide to change anything. If they were to make any changes, I would need to update my fetch call and parsing that data. Also, vue could decide
        to make changes then I would have to update the code.

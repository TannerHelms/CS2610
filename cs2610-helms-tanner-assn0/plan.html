            <h3>Phase 0: Requirements Specification</h3>
            <div style="margin-left:60px">
                <p>
                    The purpose of this assignemnt is to create a blog for a client so that they can post
                    about some of the things they are doing. They also need a about me page so that someone can
                    visit the page and learn more about them. The website also contains a page with helpful tips so
                    that the page can look better. The better the page looks, the more traction it will get! There is also
                    a page without any css sheet to show how much css can beatify your page!
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Phase 2: Implementation</h3>
            <div style="margin-left:60px">
                <p>
                    To implement our creation of the page, it will be done in html and css. HTML contains certain elements that
                    helps us organize our code, so that its easy to read for the view. Then we will use css to style the page and
                    make it more pleasing on the eye
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Phase 3: Testing & Debugging</h3>
            <div style="margin-left:60px">
                <p>
                    When I was validating my html files using  W3Cs Markup Validation Service, I had some errors since I didnt use an alt
                    tag on the photos. When using an alt tag, if the photo doesnt exist, then it will display the alt text instead of nothing.
                    <br>
                    Another error that I had, was that I didnt have lang="en" in the beginning html tag. This is important as it tells us what language that
                    the page is in.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Phase 4: Deployment</h3>
            <div style="margin-left:60px;">
                <p>
                    For the Deployment part of this project, we run the webpage on a browser. When I was programming this, I was using
                    google chrome. To display this code on chrome, you open the browser, then drag and drop the .html file onto the browser.
                    It will turn all the code into an actual webpage.
                    <br><br>
                    While programming the page, we use git for version control. This will allow us to back up to a previous version just in case
                    we have some code that doesnt work and we cant fix it. Git also allows us to work on projects as a group as it stores the
                    code on a server. To turn this project in, we can use git add . to add all the files to a local commit. Then we can use
                    git commit -m to create an initial commit with a message. Then we can use git push to push all the code to the server. This will
                    also turn in the project to the respository.
                </p>

            </div>
            <h3>Phase 5: Maintenance</h3>
            <div style="margin-left:60px;">
                <p>
                    In terms of Maintenance, there wont be much we need to update on this page for along time. All of the tags that are used, are up to date
                    with html 5. But in the future we could add in some buttons that would allow the client to create new posts or add photos to their about
                    me page. I feel like this whole project is written pretty organized and there isnt any sloppy parts. Anyone who looks at this code to the website
                    should be able to understand it fairly well. It will also be really easy to add any features to this website in the future. This website
                    will work on any machine and any future browser that comes out, unless something crazy happens in HTML 5 over the next couple of years.
